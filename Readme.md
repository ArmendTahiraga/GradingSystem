# Grading System

-   As the principal, I want to be able to oversee the work of the teachers.
-   As a teacher, I want to leave comments for students.
-   As a parent, I can only view my child's grades and receive their report card.
-   As a student, I want to be able to see my grades.
-   As a teacher I want to access and change the grades of students.
